# ng2-mselect-tags

[[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/ng2-mselect-tags.svg)]()](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-mselect-tags)

Angular 2+ MultiSelect which adds tags into a container. Click a tag to remove from the selected. The component implements a control value accessor and supports both template driven and reactive forms. AOT compatible.

This control will allow you to access any json source or list and use a '.' delimitted accessor (aa.bb.cc) to select which items to list in the container using autocomplete. When you a click on an item in the list the control would list its object as a value. Just like a normal select form input with a multiselect option.

### Installation

To install this library, run:

```bash
$ npm install ng2-mselect-tags --save
```

### Consuming your library

Once you have published your library to npm, you can import your library in any Angular application by running:

```bash
$ npm install ng2-mselect-tags
```

and then from your Angular `AppModule`:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Import your library
import { MSelectTagsModule } from 'ng2-mselect-tags';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,

    // Specify your library as an import
    MSelectTagsModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Once your library is imported, you can include its module in your Angular application:

```xml
<!-- You can now use your library component in app.component.html -->
<h1>
  {{title}}
</h1>
<ng2-mselect-tags></ng2-mselect-tags>
```

### Development

To generate all `*.js`, `*.d.ts` and `*.metadata.json` files:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

To lint all `*.ts` files:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

To test in application, 
1. create a new app with AngularCli named 'compotester'.
2. run

```bash
$ npm build:test
```
3. The component will be copied into '../compotester/node_modules/ng2-mselect-tags'. You can change the above defaults in the 'package.json'.

### Disclaimer

This is a simple component with a specific purpose in its early stages of development. I have used this to learn about building and publishing components. It is generated using a Yeoman Generator and utilises rollup to produce AOT compatible FESM. Happy to improve it and receive critique or feature requests :)
